# BitBurrow: New base router

{{ headline(text='**New base router**', align='center') }}

**Notes:**

* These steps should be done at your "VPN home".
* Be aware that, by following these steps, you are giving this BitBurrow hub full control of the new base router.
* Below, "your device" refers to the phone, tablet, or laptop you are currently using to connect
to this website.

**Steps:**

1. Check your device's IP address while connected to the existing router and note the subnet, often "192.168.1".
1. Connect your device to the new base router (via WiFi or Ethernet).
1. Check your device's new IP address. If it has the same subnet as the existing router,
you will need to change the subnet of the new base router.
1. On your device, browse to [http://192.168.8.1](http://192.168.8.1), where "192.168.8" is the
new subnet of your device.
1. Sign in. The default GL-iNet admin password is: **`goodlife`**
