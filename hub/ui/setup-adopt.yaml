  title: Signing in to the base router
  md: |-
    1. If the base router is new, follow the on-screen directions:
        * Choose a language.
        * Create a new admin password and write it down. You will need it below.
    1. If you are asked to sign in but don't know the password, you will need to
       factory-reset the router and start over.
