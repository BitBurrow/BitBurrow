      ## Connect your new router to the internet.
      * Make a note of the existing configuration in case there is a problem setting 
        up the new router.
      * You will need an Ethernet cable. (One may have come with your new router.) 
        Connect one end to any of the unused LAN jacks on the existing router. 
        Connect the other end to the WAN jack on your new router. The LAN jacks 
        are sometimes labeled "Ethernet" or "Ethernet out" or simply numbered 
        1, 2, etc. The WAN jack is sometimes labeled "Ethernet In", 
        "Internet", with a globe symbol, or is unlabeled but uniquely colored.

      * In some situations it is possible to install the new router *in place 
        of*  the existing one, but this can be trickier to set up. Unless you 
        feel confident doing this, keep your existing router as described above 
        for now. You can change it later. Note, though, that replacing your 
        existing router will be more reliable in the long run. However, it is 
        generally only possible if the existing set-up consists of a modem (DSL, 
        ADSL, cable, fiber, etc.) and a router, connected by an Ethernet cable. 
        Disconnect the Ethernet cable from the existing router and connect it to 
        the WAN jack on your new router. The WAN jack is sometimes labeled "Ethernet 
        In", "Internet", with a globe symbol, or is unlabeled but uniquely 
        colored. [More details.](/one-router-details)

      ## Connect to the new router via WiFi.
      * Enable WiFi if needed and scan for available WiFi networks.
      * For the GL-AX1800, the WiFi name will be `GL-AX1800-xxx` or 
        `GL-AX1800-xxx-5G` and the WiFi password written on the bottom of 
        the router, labeled "WiFi Key".
      * It is sometimes necessary to turn off mobile data (internet via 
        your cellular provider).
